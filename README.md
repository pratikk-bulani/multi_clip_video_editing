# Multi-Clip Video Editing from a Single Viewpoint

This is my own implementation of the paper: "Multi-Clip Video Editing from a Single Viewpoint" linked https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01067093/document

## Execution

In order to execute, run the script.py file. Modify the ```execution_dict = {video_name: [shots to extract]}```
An example for this is: ```execution_dict = {"afraid_6":["MS 0", "MS 0,1", "MS 1"]}``` where "afraid_6" is the video name and "MS 0" is the Medium Shot for the first actor.
